                <h1>UNiDAYS Competency and Progression Framework</h1>
                <h2>üîÆ Usage</h1>
                <p>This framework outlines examples of desirable behaviours and skills, arranged into different high level competencies, finer grained topics and individual levels. It is a tool that helps employees and managers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>make development and career plans</li>
                    <li>talk about what we're looking for from each role in a consistent way</li>
                    <li>set a fair level of compensation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The framework is a compass, not a GPS.</p>
                <p>It's meant to be helpful. It's not meant to be a rating system for humans, free from edge cases.</p>
                <h2>üôã How does it work?</h3>
                <p>The framework covers all the things we're looking for from each role at UNiDAYS. We have a suite of core-competencies and then more specific ones for each role.</p>
                <p>Each competency topic is sorted into levels and we try to give specific examples of behaviours we expect for each.</p>
                <p>Your manager will work with you on this. None of it will happen mysteriously behind closed doors. You'll agree what level of progression you're going for and what you need to improve on with your manager. It should be clear how you're doing relative to that at all times.</p>
                <h2>üß† Things to keep in mind</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are many different ways to progress and be valuable to UNiDAYS as you grow, including deep technical knowledge and ability, leadership and people management. All are equally valuable paths.</li>
                    <li>The framework represents a career's worth of progression, people shouldn't expect to fly up it in 18 months!</li>
                    <li>Progression isn't an exact science and there will always be some ambiguity.</li>
                    <li>This isn't a checklist ‚Äì it's possible to progress up a level without showing all the behaviours in that level.</li>
                    <li>You can find some more information in these links. If that doesn't answer most of your questions, please ask your manager.</li>
                    <li>The skills/behaviours listed are a guide. The list is not exhaustive. Use it to have a understanding of what‚Äôs expected of you currently and what you can do to advance yourself.</p>
                    <li>In reviews with your line manager, both of you should review the skills/behaviours expected of you and identify missing/weaker areas to work on</p>
                    <li>The expected skills/behaviours form part of your performance reviews. It is expected within reviews that you can provide evidence/commentary (where not already implicit) for each skill/behaviour. You should certainly do this for the skills/behaviours you‚Äôve been working on</p>
                    <li>You should reflect on this framework regularly and track your skills/ behaviours</p>
                </ul>
                <h2>Give us your feedback!</h3>
                <p>This is only the first version of our framework and we really want your feedback.</p>
                <p>We're particularly keen to add as many examples to the behaviours as possible, to further clarify them.</p>
